## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ross Harrison and I am currently a junior at Oakland University studying Computer Science.
I have a passion for data analytics and data science, which is the career that I am most interested in exploring!

I have prior experience in Java, Python, SQL, React, tailwind CSS, minor experience in javascript, and some software engineering experience in CAPL script

Currently, I am working on three different projects:
  - Budget tracking website using JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS
  - Database project using SQL to store, organize, and retreieve data based on stock market information
  - Group project that is TBD

Prior projects include:
  - Battleship game with AI implementation for the opponent
  - (Beginner) Hangman game
      - This was my first project so very beginner friendly and easy to understand

I also have some internship experience as a software engineer intern at Marquardt Switches INC.
